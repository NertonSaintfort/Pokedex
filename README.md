# Pokedex

Hello welcome this is my fourth project is a simple web application that uses the Pokemon API to display information about Pokemon. The user can search for a specific Pokemon by name or ID and see its details, such as its name, image, and type(s).

## Features

- Image of pok√®mon and type
- Pokedex placement
- Allow the user to search for Pokemon by name.

## Acknowledgements
